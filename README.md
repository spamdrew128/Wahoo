# Bitboard Chess Engine in Rust

Name: Wahoo

Author: Andrew Hockman

# About
A superhuman chess engine designed to surpass my old C engine (found at https://github.com/spamdrew128/Apotheosis). Currently ranked number 148 and 2876 Elo according to CCRL blitz list (https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/)

# How to build:
`make TB=(Y/N)` (TB enables/disables Syzygy tablebase support)

# UCI
This is not a complete chess program, you need a UCI compatible program to run it.

Cute Chess is one that I typically use, you can find it here: https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess

Alternatively, you can challenge it on Lichess at https://lichess.org/@/Wahoo_Bot, assuming I am hosting the bot at the time the request is sent.
